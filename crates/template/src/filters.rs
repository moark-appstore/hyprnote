        [SPEAKER 1]
        michael is right it's a made up word used to trick students

        [SPEAKER 3]
        no actually whomever is the formal version of the word

        [SPEAKER 0]
        obviously it's a real word but i don't know when to use it correctly

        [SPEAKER 1]
        not a native speaker

        [SPEAKER 2]
        i know what's right but i'm not gonna say because you're all jerks who didn't come see my band last night

        [SPEAKER 0]

        [SPEAKER 2]
        i don't know

        [SPEAKER 0]
        it's whom when it's the object of the sentence and who when it's the subject subject that sounds right

        [SPEAKER 1]
        well sounds right but is it

        [SPEAKER 2]
        how did ryan use it as an object as

        [SPEAKER 3]
        to whomever meaning us the indirect object which is the correct usage of the word
